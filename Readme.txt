## Why Build This?
### Learning to Code
One of the primary motivations behind initiating this project was to delve into the realm of web development and gain hands-on experience with coding. By building this portfolio website, I aimed to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among other relevant technologies.

Open-source philosophy lies at the heart of this project. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and resources with the community. Therefore, the codebase for this portfolio website is made available for free, enabling others to utilize, modify, and learn from it. By contributing to the pool of freely accessible resources, I aim to foster a collaborative and inclusive environment where individuals can empower themselves through coding.
